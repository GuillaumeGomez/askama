# Rinja

Rinja implements a template rendering engine based on [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/).
It generates Rust code from your templates at compile time
based on a user-defined `struct` to hold the template's context.
See below for an example.

All feedback welcome! Feel free to file bugs, requests for documentation and
any other feedback to the [issue tracker][issues].

Have a look at our [*Rinja Playground*](https://rinja-rs.github.io/play-rinja/),
if you want to try out rinja's code generation online.

### Feature highlights

* Benefit from the safety provided by Rust's type system
* Template code is compiled into your crate for optimal performance
* Optional built-in support for Actix, Axum, Rocket, and warp web frameworks
* Debugging features to assist you in template development
